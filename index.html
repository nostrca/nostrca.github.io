<h2>FAQ</h2>
<strong>Is it free?</strong><BR>
<em>Yes!</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>Why?</strong><BR>
<em>Why not?</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>Is a free service sustainable?</strong><BR>
<em>Everything is hosted on GitHub Pages and no costs are incurred.</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>Does that mean the service could get shut down at some point?</strong><BR>
<em>If GitHub Pages doesn't work out I'll try this from a VPS, but if the costs get out of hand, yes, it's possible that the service could shut down. This is another reason it's completely free</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>How can we help keep the service sustainable?</strong><BR>
<em>Although there's no cost, we wouldn't be sad if people wanted to zap a few sats to nostr@nostr.ca.</em><BR>
<BR>
<strong>Are you affiliated with the Nostr protocol or nostr.com?</strong><BR>
<em>Absolutely not, just a Nostr fan that's trying to help expand the ecosystem.</em>
